About
=====
Orthosie is a point of sale system written in Python using the Django framework.
Orthosie supports Python 3 and Django 1.10

Supported Systems
=================
Orthosie should work on any operating system and any hardware that can run python3 and the Django 1.8 framework. It is only tested to work with Chrome/Chromium and Midori web browsers. Patches and pull requests to fix bugs in any other browsers are always welcome as long as they don't add any undo clutter to the codebase.

Install
=======
These instructions are for debian-based versions of GNU/Linux. It is recommended that you use virtualenvwrapper to segment the orthosie libraries from the rest of your python environment.

Required Packages
-----------------
    sudo apt-get install python3 python3-pip python3-setuptools git 

VirtualEnvWrapper
-----------------
    sudo pip3 install virtualenvwrapper
    mkdir ~/virtualenvs
Add the following to your shell init script. e.g. ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc

    export VIRTUALENVWRAPPER_PYTHON=/usr/bin/python3
    export WORKON_HOME=~/virtualenvs

[Initialize virtualwrapper](http://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html#introduction)

    source /usr/local/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh
    
Create a virtual environment for Orthosie.

    mkvirtualenv orthosie

Orthosie
--------
    cd ~
    git clone https://github.com/maxolasersquad/orthosie.git

Pip Packages
------------
    cd orthosie
    pip install -r requirements/common.txt
    pip install -r requirements/dev.txt
    pip install -r requirements/prod.txt

SQLite Database
---------------
Getting Orthosie running for the first time requires we setup the sqlite database file.
If you have a different database you want to use, refer to the django documentation at https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.10/ref/databases/

    python3 manage.py makemigrations
    python3 manage.py migrate

Running
=======
To run the test server cd in to the orthosie directory and run the following.

    python3 manage.py runserver

At this point you can browse to http://127.0.0.1:8000/register/ to see the register.

This server should only be used for testing your setup and maybe even an initial configuration. For your production setup you should use nginx, Apache, or any other webserver of your choosing.

Nginx

The following article explains setting up nginx on Ubuntu to connect to a django application.

Apache2
-------
The following article explains setting up Apache2 on Ubuntu to connect to a django application.

Adding Inventory
================
You can modify existing inventory from http://127.0.0.1:8000/inventory/

Running the Register
====================
The register is located at http://127.0.0.1:8000/register/
You should be able to ring up this product. Note that during the ring the UPC checksum is needed for a ring to go through properly, so you will need to input '008274000061' for the ring to work.
